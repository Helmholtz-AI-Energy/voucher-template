## Helmholtz AI Local Unit Energy Voucher Template

The Helmholtz AI voucher system provides various scientific support in applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) research questions with respect to tools and methods in AI, ML and data science. All researchers of the Helmholtz Association can apply to enable short term collaborations and exciting projects. 

This scientific AI support will be provided by AI Consultants; these experts will be located at the six different Helmholtz AI units, i.e. Helmholtz Zentrum München (HMGU), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Forschungszentrum Jülich (FZJ), Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht (HZG), Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR). 

To match requests of researchers with the expertise of AI Consultants, a centralized and digital Helmholtz AI voucher system is being established. In the mean time, all offered support activities are managed via file-based documentation. Here you can find the template for the Helmholtz AI Local Unit Energy situated at KIT. All support activities must be accomplished in the timeframe of two weeks up to six months.

You may choose to fill out the voucher skeletton in Microsoft Word, Open Office/LibreOffice Writer, LaTeX or Markdown. Please send the filled out voucher to the Helmholtz AI Local Unit Energy [mail address](mailto:consultant-helmholtz.ai@kit.edu).
